- Robots are placed on nearly square board monitored by camera hung on the ceiling
- Camera tracks robots' positions
- User can select between two modes of control: Manual (Xbox controller/keybord), Automatic (writing scenarios that controls all the robots)
- Generic architecture providing effortless extension of project (i.e. adding new controllers and stuff)
